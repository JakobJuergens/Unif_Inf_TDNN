\subsection{Outlook}
\hrule
The promising results of this paper lay out a few avenues for continued research.
A first idea to potentially improve on the performance of the implemented weighting scheme is to use weights that correspond to a column-subsampled version of the (T)DNN weighting scheme.
In the context of RF this is a commonly employed technique that helps to de-correlate the individual trees that are used to construct the RF.
This decorrelation has been shown to be an integral part of the desirable performance that RF delivers in practice via simulation studies.
In the context of this paper, a similar effect can be expected to take place while having the potential to still be expressible in a relatively simple, principled closed-form weighting scheme.
