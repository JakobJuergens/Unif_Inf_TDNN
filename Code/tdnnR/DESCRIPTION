Description: This package implements the DNN and TDNN estimators described in Deimarkaya et al. (2024)
    including functions for pointwise inference and pointwise confidence intervals.
    Furthermore, it implements the uniform confidence bands described in Juergens (202?) inspired by
    Ritzwoller and Syrgkanis (2024 wp).
